# Acadia Transit Sentinel

This project provides advanced route analysis tailored for large vehicles. Use
the **Route Planning** tab to set your origin, destination, and any stops. Drag
the markers on this planning map to fine‑tune exact locations. Once satisfied,
analyze the route to view the three safest options. The **Route Analysis** view
now shows results on a read‑only map so adjustments stay focused on the planning
stage.
