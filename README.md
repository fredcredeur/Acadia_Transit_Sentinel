# Acadia Transit Sentinel

This project provides advanced route analysis tailored for large vehicles. Use
the **Route Planning** tab to drop markers for your origin, destination, and
any stops. Only the pins appear on this map so you can position them precisely.
Click **Analyze Routes** to see the three safest options. The **Route Analysis**
view then displays those routes on a readâ€‘only map, keeping adjustments focused
on the planning stage.
